Hello! I'm a British 27 year old living in Saitama Prefecture. I've been living in Japan for a little over 4 years. This is the story of how I got here.

I studied chemistry at the University of Oxford until 2013. When I graduated, I had no idea what I wanted to do next. I knew one thing, though: it definitely wasn't chemistry!

I saw a job listing for a job teaching in an elementary school by sheer luck: the principal of that school was a friend of a girl studying in my college. She sent an email to college members. Since at the time I had no job, no partner, and no debt, I thought it would be my only chance to leave the UK and experience life in a different culture. If it wasn't for me, I could always move back to the UK.

And here I am, 4 years later. I really love living here, and I've met so many nice people, including my wonderful partner. I want to continue to live in Japan, but I don't want to be an elementary school teacher my entire life.

I was fortunate enough to hear about Code Chrysalis through Meetup, and in the summer of 2017 I attended a course for total beginners to JavaScript. It was my first time to use JS, and I found it fascinating. I signed up for Harvard's CS50x programme, and discovered a new interest in computer science.

I've been interested in computing since a very early age. My uncle gave me his Amiga A1200 and would sit for hours playing with the games and applications that came with it. At my elementary school, I knew my way around Windows 95 better than my teacher. I accidentally overwrote the BIOS on my parents' Windows XP machine. We got the Internet in 2003 (dial-up!) and I bought myself a tablet computer with the earnings from my first job in 2006, which was selling computers in a big box retailer. In 2010, I took a part-time job helping to fix computer software problems for my university. And I try to use technology as best I can as an elementary school teacher.

I was never interested in programming, though, which I blame squarely on the education system of the time. Throughout my education I was never introduced to programming concepts. IT lessons consisted of learning to use MS Office.

In many ways I am still a total beginner. I'm looking forward to studying with you, and I hope we can learn and grow during our 12 weeks together.
